## Chapter 1 – “Our future as developers”

### Prince's Thoughts:

### Ravi's Thoughts:
My only goal as of now is to work in a code-related role. I would consider myself lucky to be doing so <br>
at any point in my career. My background as a software engineer trained via the University of Washington <br>
serves me in order to be someone who is primarily a backend engineer. However, I am open to other roles. <br>
With enough work experience on my side (and the familiarity required of company-specific or <br>
role-specific knowledge), it would be a pleasure to work in a management role at some point in the future.
